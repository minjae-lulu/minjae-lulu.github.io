## About Me

I am a Combined MS-PhD in [CSE](https://cse.unist.ac.kr/) at [UNIST](https://www.unist.ac.kr/) advised by Prof. [Hyeonwoo yu](https://bogus2000.github.io/) where I am a member of UNIST Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ([Lair](https://lair.unist.ac.kr/)) Lab. My current research interests include neural radiance field, deep learning, robotics.

<br>
<!-- From the very beginning of undergraduate studies (sophomore), I have been interested in participating in research activities in the areas of Computer Science. During 2020, I have worked as a research assistant in Software Engineering lab with focus on patch validation, and later I was a research assistant in Applied Cryptography lab with focus on privacy-preserving machine learning. -->
